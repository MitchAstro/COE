# Centre for Organic Electronics (COE)
This repo contains two of the main programs I used to analyse the performance efficiency of organice electronic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells.  The output from the solar simulator is in a difficult format to edit.  Within the COE this has been done in Excel for years and this approach lacked efficiency.  Collegues within the COE have since begun using my code with a reported saving of ~2hours per day.

## OPV_summary_files_and_plots
This is a fairly simple program that produces plots of individual and grousp of OPV performance.  OPVs with obvious manufacturing flaws are discarded from the analysis.

## statistical_analysis_solar_cells
This program performs statistical analysis of OPVs including statistical hypothesis testing.
