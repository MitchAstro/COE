# Centre for Organic Electronics (COE)
This repo contains two of the main programs I used to analyse the performance efficiency of organice electronic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells.  The output from the solar simulator is in a difficult format to edit and within the COE this has been previously done in Excel which was inefficient approach.  Team members have since begun using my code with a reported saving of ~2hours per day.

## OPV_summary_files_and_plots
This is a fairly simple program that produces plots of individual and grousp of OPV performance.  OPVs with obvious manufacturing flaws are discarded from the analysis.

## statistical_analysis_solar_cells
This program performs statistical analysis of OPVs including statistical hypothesis testing.
