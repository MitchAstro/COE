# Centre for Organic Electronics (COE)
This repo contains two of the main programs I used to analyse organice electronic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells.  The output from the solar simulator is in a difficult format to edit and I personally refused to do this in Excel due to the time it would take (Excel was the standard tool used).  Team members have since begun using my code with a reported saving of ~2hours per day.

## OPV_summary_files_and_plots
This is a fairly simple program that produces plots of individual and grousp of OPV performance.  OPV's with obvious manufacturing floors are discarded from the analysis.

## statistical_analysis_solar_cells
This program performs statistical analysis of the solar cells.
